```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(CodeClanData)
```

```{r}

game_sales %>% 
  select(platform) %>% 
  group_by(platform) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())
# there are 12 genres

```


```{r}
game_sales %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = platform, y = sales) +
  geom_col()
```


Change this to a plot showing critic score vs user score for each genre (chosen
from a drop down)
```{r}
game_sales %>%
 # filter(genre == "Action") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = critic_score, y = user_score) +#, colour = genre) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~genre)
```



```{r}
game_sales %>%
  filter(genre == "Action") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = critic_score, y = user_score, colour = platform) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r}
game_sales %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = platform, y = sales) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~genre)
```

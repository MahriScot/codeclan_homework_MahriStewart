The data for the joining tasks is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ananta/credit-card-data) and contains synthetic (fake) credit card information and transactions. The data for the `tidyr` tasks is also synthetic.

# MVP

## Joins

<br>
**Question 1**

Read in all 4 credit card transaction datasets and clean column names.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
card_base <- read_csv("data/CardBase.csv")
customer_base <- read_csv("data/CustomerBase.csv")
fraud_base <- read_csv("data/FraudBase.csv")
transaction_base <- read_csv("data/TransactionBase.csv")

library(janitor)

card_base <- card_base %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

customer_base <- customer_base %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

fraud_base <- fraud_base %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

transaction_base <- transaction_base  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


card_base
customer_base
fraud_base
transaction_base
```


**Question 2**

Join the data containing card details and customer details by customer id, so that all records of card details and any matching records in customer details are kept. Before you run the code, think about how many rows you expect to see after joining.

```{r}

card_base
customer_base

card_details <- left_join(card_base, customer_base, "cust_id")
card_details


```


**Question 3**

Join the data containing fraud details with transaction details so all rows of both tables are kept. What does the resulting row number tell you?

```{r}
fraud_base
transaction_base

transaction_details <- full_join(fraud_base, transaction_base, by = "transaction_id")
transaction_details

# all of the fraud_base data is in the transaction_base data

```


**Question 4**

Join the data containing card details with transaction details so rows from the first which have matching ones in the second are returned, but only return rows in the first table once.


```{r}
card_details
transaction_details

renamed_card_details <- card_details %>%       #card_number and credit_card_id are the same?
  rename(credit_card_id = card_number) 
renamed_card_details

card_transaction_joined <- semi_join(renamed_card_details, transaction_details, by = "credit_card_id")
card_transaction_joined


```



## `tidyr`

**Question 5**

Read in `hat_observations` and separate `observation` into two columns, `hat_colour` and `hat_type`.

```{r}
hats <- read_csv("data/hat_observations.csv")

hats <- hats %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
hats

hat_observations_separated <- hats %>% 
  separate(observation, 
           into = c("hat_colour", "hat_type"), 
           sep = ",")



```


**Question 6**

Unite `day`, `month`, and `year` columns into a column called `date` using a suitable separator. Then find the date where the most berets were observed.

```{r}

date_united <- hat_observations_separated %>% 
  unite("Date", day, month, year, sep = "/")
date_united



```



# Extension

## Joins

**Question 1**

Can you join all 4 datasets together so that you're left with a dataset that looks like below with **109 rows** and **12 columns**?

![](images/all_joined.png)


```{r}



# card_transaction_joined 
# customer_base
# fraud_base

# card_trans_cust_join <- left_join(card_transaction_joined, customer_base, "cust_id")
# card_trans_cust_join

# all_four_joined <- left_join(card_trans_cust_join, fraud_base, "")

#this doesn't work - need to join fraud to something first (it only has 2 variables )



card_base
customer_base
transaction_base
fraud_base

transaction_and_fraud <- inner_join(transaction_base, fraud_base, "transaction_id")
transaction_and_fraud 

#previously did card and trans together - again have "card number" and "credit_card_id

# renamed_card_details in card_transaction_joined

card_trans_and_fraud <- inner_join(transaction_and_fraud, card_transaction_joined, "credit_card_id")
card_trans_and_fraud

# i have now got 109 by 12 but need to add in customer base... cust_id is the same

# all_four_combined <- inner_join(card_trans_and_fraud, customer_base, "cust_id")
# all_four_combined


# oh no - it went up to 15... 

#try 2

all_four_combined <- semi_join(card_trans_and_fraud, customer_base, "cust_id")
 all_four_combined


 # YAY! (though it's not in the same order...)

```



## `tidyr`

**Question 2**

Read in `exam_scores` and transform it into long format with two new columns `exam_question` and `score`. Then, using `separate` and `select`, remove superfluous information from the values in `exam_question`

```{r}
exam_scores <- read_csv("data/exam_scores.csv")
exam_scores

library(tidyr)

exam_scores_long <- exam_scores %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-id), 
               names_to = "exam_question", 
               values_to = "score") 
exam_scores_long

exam_question_separated <- exam_scores_long %>%
  separate(exam_question, c("exam", "question"), sep = "_" ) %>% 
  select(id, question, score)
exam_question_separated


```

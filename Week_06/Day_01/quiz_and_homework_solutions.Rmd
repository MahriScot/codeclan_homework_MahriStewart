# MVP

## The Titanic

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Fig. 1.** The RMS Titanic leaving Southport, 10th April 1912 (public domain)", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RMS_Titanic.jpg")
```

A data set detailing the survival or death of passengers and crew members on the RMS Titanic is given in the `data` folder for this homework - use this data and **not** the built-in `Titanic` dataset in `R`. 

Some time after the disaster a journalist wrote that crew members were *more likely* to have survived the sinking than passengers. This was disputed by a descendant of one of the surviving crew members, who suggested that the opposite was true, i.e. passengers were *more likely* to have survived than crew.  

**Question**  
Calculate the conditional probabilities $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{crew})$ and $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{passenger})$ to settle this dispute.

Have a look at the distinct values of the `class` variable, this will tell you whether each individual was a passenger (1st, 2nd or 3rd class) or a member of the crew (treat restaurant staff as crew)

**Loading packages**

You may want to use `prob` and `gtools` later in the homework, and the `tidyverse` for this section, but if you load `prob` after `tidyverse`, `dplyr::filter()` will be masked. So load your packages in this order:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(prob)
library(gtools)
library(tidyverse)
```

<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>

* You may want to create a `crew` column containing values `TRUE` or `FALSE` to help with this
* For $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{crew})$ think 'what proportion of the crew survived?', and similar for $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{passenger})$ 
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
```{r}
titanic <- read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
head(titanic)
```

```{r}
# get initial counts of class
titanic %>%
  count(class)

# create the crew variable
titanic <- titanic %>%
  mutate(crew = class %in% c("engineering crew", "victualling crew", "restaurant staff", "deck crew"))

# sanity check, do numbers here match up to totals in earlier counts? Yep!
titanic %>%
  count(crew)
```

Ok, now we can get the probabilities of those who were crew surviving, vs those who were not crew. 

```{r}
titanic_probs <- titanic %>%
  group_by(crew) %>%
  summarise(prob = sum(survived == "yes") / n()) 

titanic_probs
```

So, to get $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \mid \textrm{ crew })$:

```{r}
titanic_probs %>%
  filter(crew == TRUE)
```

And finally $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \mid \textrm{ passenger })$:

```{r}
titanic_probs %>%
  filter(crew == FALSE)
```

So passengers were 1.6 times more likely to have survived the disaster than crew.

Here's the appropriate contingency table:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
titanic %>%
  tabyl(crew, survived) %>%
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>%
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "all") %>%
  adorn_rounding(digits = 4) %>%
  adorn_title()
```

## Probability Consolidation Questions

Today was pretty full-on! Here are some problems to help you consolidate what you learned. Feel free to work on paper or in `R`, whichever you are most comfortable with:

**MVP - try _four_ of the problems**  
**Extension - try more than four!**

<br>
**Question 1.**  
If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
```{r}
# essentially you want : 4/6 (number of valid options <5 / total options)
one_roll <- rolldie(1)
roll_less_5 <- one_roll %>%
  filter(X1 < 5)

prob <- nrow(roll_less_5) / nrow(one_roll)
prob
```
</details>
<br>
**Question 2.**  
How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
```{r}
# For this, you're just looking to work out how many possible outcomes you can have for the three dice rolls. 

# can either do this using the multiple step counting rule
count_rule <- 6 * 6 * 6

# or just brute force using one of the `prob` functions
three_rolls <- nrow(rolldie(3))
three_rolls 
```
</details>
<br>

**Question 3.**  
In an experiment where we roll four dice:

  * how many outcomes are in the event where the total of the four dice equals $5$, $6$ or $7$)?
  * what is the probability of this event?
  * what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
For part i, `rowSums(.)` may help you setup up the necessary random variable `total` (or you can use `pivot_longer()`)
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
```{r}
# how many outcomes are in the event where the total of the four dice equals $5$, $6$ or $7$)?

# set up the variable
four_rolls <- rolldie(4)

# add total random variable
four_rolls <- four_rolls %>%
  mutate(total = rowSums(.))

# now find the rows where the total is 5, 6 or 7
total_between_5_7 <- four_rolls %>%
  filter(total %in% c(5, 6, 7))

nrow(total_between_5_7)
```

```{r}
#  What is the probability of this event?
prob <-nrow(total_between_5_7) / nrow(four_rolls)
prob
```

```{r}

# what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?
# We assume all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely!
# i.e. the dice are all unbiased
```
</details>
<br>

**Question 4.**  
Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
This is an arrangement where order matters. Of all the possible arrangements, how many are correct?
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
```{r}
# number of ordered arrangements:
num_outcomes <- factorial(5)

# only one of these is correctly ordered:
prob_perfect_order <- 1/num_outcomes
prob_perfect_order
```
</details>
<br>
**Question 5.**  
I roll six dice:

  * what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
  * what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?
  
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
Have a look at the `isin()` function in the `prob` package. For example, to `filter` all rows containing $6$, $1$, $2$ in that order, you could use `isin(., c(6, 1, 2), ordered = TRUE)`
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>
  
```{r}
six_rolls <- rolldie(6)

# what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
prob <- 1 / nrow(six_rolls)
prob

# or 'mathematically': there are 6^6 outcomes on roll of six dice, of which only one is correct
prob <- 1 / 6^6
prob
```

```{r}
# what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?

# row must contain 6, 5,..., 1, but can occur in any order
contains_654321 <- six_rolls %>%
  filter(isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = FALSE))

prob <- nrow(contains_654321) / nrow(six_rolls)
prob

```
</details>
<br>
**Question 6.**  
If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades? <br>

<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>

* Investigate the `cards()` function in the `prob` package, if you'd like to try this in R (make a deck without jokers). 
* You could think about adding your own `black_card` random variable to the sample space, which would be `TRUE` if the `suit` is 'Spade' or 'Club', and `FALSE` otherwise.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>

```{r}
# this is a conditional probability problem.
# possible source of confusion here: the conditioning event comes first

# set up the card draw
card_draw <- cards(jokers = FALSE)

# add in the conditions to show which are black cards, and which arent
card_draw <- card_draw %>%
  mutate(black_card = (suit == "Club" | suit == "Spade"))

# now we can filter the rows we want, and figure out the probability of getting a black spade
spades_and_black_card <- card_draw %>%
  filter(black_card == TRUE & suit == "Spade")
prob_spades_and_black <- nrow(spades_and_black_card) / nrow(card_draw)

# we can figure out the probability of getting a black card now
black_card <- card_draw %>%
  filter(black_card == TRUE)
prob_black <- nrow(black_card) / nrow(card_draw)

# now we can figure out the conditional probability
prob_spades_given_black <- prob_spades_and_black / prob_black
prob_spades_given_black

# or 'mathematically',
# 'it is black' limits event space to 52/2 = 26 cards
# next, only two suits are black, so card will be a spade 13/26 of the time, i.e. 1/2
# in plain language, IF we know the card is black, it will be a spade half the time
```
